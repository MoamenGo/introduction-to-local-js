# A brief history of JavaScript
# Why JavaScript is so useful today
There are two main reasons why JavaScript became so popular in web development; its ability to
render dynamic content, and its ability to perform asynchronous tasks.
===============================================================================================
# In the early days of the web, all web pages were static, which means
that the data displayed on the page was loaded by the browser ahead of time,
and the page would need to be re-loaded for any updates to show up.
===============================================================================================
# Websites are dynamic 
when they are able to render new data without reloading the page, and this is the type of behavior that 
avaScript was designed to do. 
For example, because of JavaScript, we are able to see new messages show up in a social media feed without 
having to refresh the page.
